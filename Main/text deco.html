    <!-- This is All about Text Decoration Tags -->

    <P><b>The b Tag</b></P>
    <p>The <b> < b > </b> HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use < b > for styling text or granting importance. If you wish to create boldface text, you should use the CSS font-weight property. If you wish to indicate an element is of special importance, you should use the < strong > element.</p>

    <p><b>Sample</b></p>
    <p>after applying the b tag on any word, the word will be Look Like <b>This, This, and This</b></p>
<hr>
    <p><i>The i Tag</i></p>

    <p><i>The < i > HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, and taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the source of the < i > naming of this element</p></i>
    
    <p><b>Sample</b></p>
    <p>after applying the b tag on any word, the word will be Look Like <i>This, This, and This</i></p>
<hr>
    <p><u>The U Tag</u></p>
    <p>The < u > HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline.</p>

    <p><b>Sample</b></p>
    <p>after applying the b tag on any word, the word will be Look Like <u>This, This, and This</u></p>
<hr>
    <pre>The Pre Tag</pre>
    <pre>The < pre > HTML element represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file. The text is typically rendered using a non-proportional, or monospaced, font. The whitespace inside this element is displayed as written.</pre>

    <pre>By default, < pre > is a block-level element, i.e. its default display value is block.</pre>
    <p><b>Sample</b></p>
    <p>after applying the pre tag on any word, the word will be Look Like <pre>This, This, and This</pre></p>
<hr>
    <s>The Strikethrough Tag</s>
    <s>The < s > HTML element render text with a strikethrough or a line through it. Use the < s > element to represent things that are no longer relevant or accurate.</s>
    
    <p><b>Sample</b></p>
    <p>after applying the Strikethrough/S tag on any word, the word will be Look Like <s>This, This, and This</s></p>
<hr>
   <big>The big tag</big>
   <p>The < big > HTML deprecated element renders the enclosed text at a font size one level larger than the surrounding text (medium becomes large, for example). The size is capped at the browser's maximum permitted font size.</p>

   <p><b>Sample</b></p>
   <p>after applying the big tag on any word, the word will be Look Like <big>This, This, and This</big></p>
<hr>
    <Small>The Small Tag</Small>
    <p>The < small > HTML element represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation. By default, it renders text within one font-size smaller, such as from small to x-small.</p>

    <p><b>Sample</b></p>
    <p>after applying the Small tag on any word, the word will be Look Like <Small>This, This, and This</Small></p>
<hr>
    <p>The <sup>Superscript</sup> Tag</p>
    <p>The < sup > HTML element specifies inline text which is to be displayed as a superscript for solely typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text.</p>

    <p><b>Sample</b></p>
    <p>after applying the big tag on any word, the word will be Look Like <sup>This, This, and This</sup></p>
<hr>
    <p>The <sub>Subscript</sub> Tag</p>
    <p>The < sub > HTML element specifies inline text which should be displayed as a subscript for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text.</p>

    <p><b>Sample</b></p>
    <p>after applying the big tag on any word, the word will be Look Like <sub>This, This, and This</sub></p>
